# Django Models with PostgreSQL

This repository explores Django models and their integration with PostgreSQL. You'll learn how to set up Django to work with a PostgreSQL database step by step.

## Installation

To integrate with PostgreSQL, follow these steps:

### 1. Install PostgreSQL Engine

You need to install the PostgreSQL engine using the `psycopg2` package. Run this command:

```bash
pip install psycopg2
```
This command installs the PostgreSQL engine, which enables PostgreSQL connections and data manipulation through Django's Object-Relational Mapping (ORM).

2. Configure settings.py
Next, you need to configure your Django project's settings.py to work with PostgreSQL. Open your settings.py file and modify the DATABASES setting as follows:

```
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2',
        'NAME': 'test',          # Your database name
        'USER': 'postgres',      # Your database username
        'PASSWORD': '',          # Your database password (leave empty if not needed)
        'HOST': 'localhost',     # Hostname (use 'localhost' for local development or specify the instance IP for remote)
        'PORT': '',              # PostgreSQL default port is 5432 (leave blank for default)
    }
}
```
Make sure to replace 'test', 'postgres', and '' with your actual database name, username, and password.

That's it! You've successfully configured your Django project to work with PostgreSQL.
